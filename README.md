This is a toy CPU simulator I have been developing.  I really enjoy the aspect of emulation and simulation of CPUs and tend to play with simh as a past time.  This is my attempt at building a register-based CPU to play around with key concepts of machine code execution.  It's very simple, nothing too advanced here.  This CPU simulator/Virtual Machine is currently being used within my online game Hacker's Edge.  Code examples can be found within the game world.
